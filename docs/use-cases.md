Use Case Narrative

User ADMIN needs a report from the world database. She runs the application and waits for the application to initialise.
When the application has initialised and the main menu is shown, the user selects an option.
The user is presented with choices that relate to the selected report (menu 2).
Once the specific report is selected, menu 3 (parameters option) is shown if relevant to the selected report.
Once the parameters are keyed in / selected - the request is sent to the server and the results printed to screen.
The user is returned to the main menu.
